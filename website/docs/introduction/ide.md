As part of the lab environment you have access to an AWS Cloud9 IDE.

To access the Cloud9 IDE, log into your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). Search for Cloud9 in the menu bar at the top of the screen:

![Search for the Cloud9 service](./assets/search.png)

When the main Cloud9 screen opens expand the menu on the left side of the screen:

![Access Cloud9 service menu](./assets/menu.png)

There will be a Cloud9 environment available, click the **Open** button to launch the IDE:

![Open the Cloud9 IDE](./assets/environment.png)

Once the IDE has loaded, we recommend you use the **+** button and select **New Terminal** to open a new full screen terminal window.

![Open new Cloud9 terminal](./assets/terminal-open.png)

This will open a new tab with a fresh terminal.

You may also close the small terminal at the bottom if you wish.

Your IDE comes pre-configured to access the workshop EKS cluster and also provides a set of tools you will need like the `aws` and `kubectl` CLI tools.
